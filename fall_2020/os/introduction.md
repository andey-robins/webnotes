Introduction
=====

Below are a number of comments on the syllabus and course introduction. Policy and information is also all available in the Syllabus. These comments are really just all the little things that get said during the overview but aren't included in writing.

Syllabus
-----
- WyoCourses will have the written assignments and everything else will be through the Seker course shell
- The final project will be covered on the exam (hint hint nudge nudge)
- Labs start the second week of class
- Final project is the biggest portion of the grade
    - "if I think you need six weeks to complete it, you probably actually need eight."
    - this is the culmination of systems classes at UW, so the workload will be large
    - *this course is designed to see what you're capable of*

Class Session
-----
- not a whole lot going on in lecture time, almost all info is in videos
- some lectures will have additive content (i.e. examples) conducted over discord
- wyosecure is a vpn service that lets us connect to a bunch of machines on campus
- university remote labs also works
    - standard pool has vs and can use
- if running on linux, just ssh onto campus computers
- if it runs on the virtual box environment provided through the course shell, it'll work
    - semiphore and fork for instance will often only work through gcc and linux
    - mac implementation of gcc is broken, so run it on linux
