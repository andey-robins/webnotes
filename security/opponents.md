Here's the famous Sun Tzu quote: "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."

"I dunno what happens if you know the enemy but not yourself" - Mike

## Design Consideration
Designers construct the system with a set of specifications to do specific tasks, and opponents will use those systems, or a subset of them, to achieve an objective beyond the original goal. As someone in a security role, you have to examine your system to understand what tools you've unwittingly created to break your own system.
