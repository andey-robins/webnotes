Psychology and Usability
=====
Psychology and Usability encompass Chapter 3 of the textbook and the related lectures.

Often times, it's not the system that gives up its secret, but the user.

## We Build Systems for Users
- we need to understand how people will use our system
- we need to understand some of the safe assumptions to make about people
- for bank logins they'll check:
    - https
    - "human readable"
    - legit looking page
    - most would fail to recognize https:/www.login.citicards.com isn't a legit page

- people have a finite list of things they can care about
- the assumptions we use when we build systems can have problematic failures
    - i.e. systems designed for male bodies that fail for female bodies
    - also i.e. facial recognition that includes racial bias due to training data

## Human Motivation
- our willingness to take risks is tied to our perception of risk versus the perceived rewards
- as we see accidents and rewards, we re-evaluate our perception of risk and propensity to take risks

### How to Influence Others
1. reciprocity - if i give you something, you'll want to give me something
2. commitment & consistency - if you do something once, or say you will, you'll try to do it
3. social proof - we like to show others we're doing good things
4. liking - we like it when we are liked
5. authority - an appeal to authority
6. scarcity - "there's only two spots left!"

### How to Influence Others - Advanced
7. distraction - misdirection
8. social compliance - trying to be a part of the expectations for society
9. herd principle - "everyone else is doing it"
10. lying - influence them through lies and deception
11. kindness - giving you a sob story or an appeal to an emotional response
12. need & greed - if i can find a need you have, i can exploit it
13. time pressure - "you have an hour before we release everything"

## Passwords
The need for passwords arrises out of the need to authenticate a user. We know Alice and Bob, and we need to differentiate between them and Eve.
