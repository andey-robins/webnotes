Access Control
=====
A security feature that controls who is able to utilize a system, resource, or network.

In general, this echoes a lot of what we've talked about already, and having read the textbook, there's nothing crazy new.

## Strategies
Four big strats:
- Discretionary Access Control
    - based solely on the owner of a resource's discretion
- Mandatory Access Control
    - access based off of a clearance/access level
- Role Based Access Control
    - based on what a user "needs-to-do" or their responsibility
    - used when lots and lots of employees have things to do
- Attribute Based Access Control
    - many attributes are used to determin if an entity has access to something
    - can use device name, file, applications, network, etc.

## AAA Framework
1. authentication
    - know who someone is
2. Authorization
    - determine if that person is allowed to do what they want
3. Accounting
    - create a way to audit/detect violations
