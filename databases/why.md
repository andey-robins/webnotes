Why Databses

Anytime an application needs information (data) it'll reach out to a database to gather that information. Then, instead of having to update a file itself, it can update the database and then the file will gather that data from the database. Nearly all applications follow that front-end, back-end, database design philosophy.

There are two kinds of databases. SQL and NoSQL. SQL is PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite etc. NoSQL is MongoDB, Redis, etc. 

Full Stack Knowledge is incredibly useful in designing a database because it allows you to build a database that makes data easy accessible and usable to the other parts of the application.

## Tables
- made up of a set of columns and rows
- each column and row is a particular type of data
- individual constraints can be applied to information
- make tables about 1 subject
- 10,000 tables is a reasonable number for an application level database

### Table Types
- config
- reference
- data
  - relativley large in comparison to config and reference tables
