Overview of Ethics
-----
Broadly speaking, theories of ethics should feed into our principles which feed into our questions about life which inform our actions. Since there is no "best" set of actions to take in any given life situation, ethics attempts to give frameworks to pick what actions to take. There are 3 main "top level" ethical theories: deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics.

####Deontology
The best action is determined by rules of duty; someone has made up the rules and you appeal to those rules (and that person).
`duty deontology(currentQuestion, rules)`

####Consequentiality
The best action is that which produces the best results. Utilitarianism is a subset of this that claims "that which creates the greatest good for the greatest number."
`[results] consequentialism(currentQuestion, resultScores)`

####Virtue Ethics
The best action is that which a virtuous person would do. This is the embodiment of "What would Jesus do?"
`actionOfGreatPerson virtueEthics(currentQuestion, greatPerson&)`

####Intuitionism
The best action is the action that you first instinctually want to pursue.

####Social Contract
The best action is what society/culture has agreed is best.

####Supernaturalism
The best action is dictated by a supernatural being/deity/dogma/something beyond the natural world.
