Creative Writing
=====
Class notes from Creative Writing 1040, Introduction to Creative Writing at the University of Wyoming. I took this class, and these notes, during the spring semester of 2020.

Day 1
-----
Prompt: An event that is continually bothersome or something quirky about me.

I absolutely love lying. Just like the little lies: someone asking what the meaning of a word is and giving the wrong definition or making up fake facts on the spot. There's just a small pleasure in being able to convince people of things that are completely inconsequential. It's similar to a life built entirely by improv. If you can subvert people's expectations by convincing them of something and then assuring them it's actually all a myth, it's funny.

Note: First half of the semester, I send things to Kate. In the second half, it swaps and I send it to Sawyer.
