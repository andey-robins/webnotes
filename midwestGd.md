Hey there folks, this is a website of mine. I encourage you to save this link (or bookmark it or whatever) because this will be the place I include writeups and information for y'all as we work to help you make the coolest games you can imagine.

I've been quite busy the last two weeks with finals, so as soon as this week is over, I'll be able to start giving some attention to helping y'all's projects move forward.

In the meantime, here are some tutorials you might find useful depending on which group you're a part of.

## Video Tutorials
- [Introduction to Character Modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzt55UfljGA?t=36)
    - This is pretty step by step, but doesn't do a lot to explain the basics of Blender, so I encourage you to familiarize yourself with blender first by looking for some tutorials of your own!
- [Character Modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljl_QFs9xhE?t=113)
    - This tutorial starts off with much more knowledge of blender required. If you want to pick up some 3D modeling techniques, looking for some beginner blender tutorials could be a good place to start!
- [Landscaping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWHV8-cVYTA?t=9)
    - This tutorial will walk you through landscape work for beginners. I know y'all were running into some specific issues, and hopefully this helps you somewhat. If not, we can start digging into your specific problems in more detail soon.
