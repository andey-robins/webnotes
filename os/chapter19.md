Distributed Systems
=====
A distributed system is a collection of lososely copuled nodes interconnected by a communications network. Nodes could be processors, computers, machines, or hosts. The nodes could be client-server, p2p, or something else.

## Why Use Them
- resource sharing is the primary motivation
- speeds up computation through distribution
- increases reliability

## Networking
Largely a high level rehash of [networking](http://andey-robins.github.io/webnotes/mdwiki#!./fall_2019/networking.md).

## Networked OSes
- network os -> users are aware of the multiplicy of systems
- distributed os -> users are not aware of the multiplicity
